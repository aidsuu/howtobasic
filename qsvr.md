## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use classical machine learning techniques like Support Vector Regression (SVR) alongside quantum computing concepts for creating a Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) model. By the end of this guide, you will be able to transform classical SVR models into quantum models to explore new ways of tackling machine learning problems.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have:
- Basic knowledge of machine learning, particularly SVR.
- Understanding of quantum computing concepts and Qiskit.
- Python and necessary libraries installed (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `qiskit`).

If you are new to Qiskit or quantum machine learning, consider reviewing the [Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/) beforehand.

## Setting up the Environment
To get started, you'll need to install some libraries. Run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib qiskit
